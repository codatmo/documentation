# Welcome to CoDatMo, the (Co)vid (Dat)a (Mo)deling project.

Documentation for the CoDatMo project 

CoDatMo (Covid Data Models) exists as a repository of COVID-19 models written in the Stan language for Bayesian modeling. Our plan is to have an individual repo for each contributed model. 

CoDatMo is a collaboration between the Unversity of Liverpool and Columbia University. 

The goal of this project is to host COVID-19 models in a common language (Stan) for idea exchange, commprability and hopefully much better modeling across the board. 

We have created directories for the current set of particpants (Liverpool, Cambirdge, Lancaster, Imperial and Manchester) with a default structure and a default license (BSD-3. 

Feel free to organize change as you see fit.
