Documentation for the CoDatMo project 

CoDatMo (Covid Data Models) exists as a repository of COVID-19 models written in the Stan language for Bayesian modeling. Our plan is to have an individual repo for each contributed model. 

CoDatMo is a collaboration between the Unversity of Liverpool and Columbia University. 

Contact fbb2116@columbia.edu (Breck Baldwin) for more information.
